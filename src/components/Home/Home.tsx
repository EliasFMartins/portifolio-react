            Currently, I am a Systems Information student at Est√°cio University
            and I am already in my fourth semester. I am passionate about
            technology and always looking to learn more. In addition to being a
            technology enthusiast, I am also dedicated and persistent.
            Currently, I am learning Node.js and React. I am looking for an
            internship to improve my knowledge and have the opportunity to put
            into practice what I have learned. I believe that I can be a great
            contributor with my technical skills and passion for technology.
